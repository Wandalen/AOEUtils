=== Fixed size strings ===

Age of Empires, Age of Empires 2, and Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds
all insert random characters after the first null ('\0') character
in the string. You can safely ignore the random characters.

These random characters may contain partial scenario names, random gibberish,
partial unit names, etc. Presumably, this is because the fixed string's buffer
is reused for multiple purposes in the game, and is not properly cleared
before being written to disc.


=== Notation ===

Data lengths: they specify both the length of the data and
how to interpret it. For example:

s32 is a signed 32-bit integer.

u16 is an unsigned 16-bit integer.

f32 is a floating point 32-bit number.

c4 is a 4-byte character string.

40 means 40 bytes of data.

fs256 means a fixed size string of 256 characters. You should ignore all
data after the first null character. (hex value of 0x00)

n*520 is an array of 'n' elements, each of which are 520 bytes long.
